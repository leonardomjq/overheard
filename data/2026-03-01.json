      "category": "ai-tools",
      "thesis": "While everyone's hyping the next big AI coding assistant, the real pain point for developers right now is that these tools are often too expensive and unreliable. The cost comes from their 'context window' (the amount of information the AI can process at once), and the unreliability comes from them 'hallucinating' (making up incorrect info) or using outdated data. This creates a massive opportunity for smart tools that make existing AI assistants cheaper and more accurate.",

That 'MCP server' signal with 435 engagements is screaming: people desperately need to cut down AI's 'thinking space' (context window) costs. You should build a smart layer that acts like a highly efficient librarian for AI coding tools, feeding them only the absolutely critical code snippets and documentation. This would dramatically reduce token usage (saving money) and prevent hallucinations from outdated info, making AI assistants reliable enough for daily use. Think about a smart code summarizer or a 'just-in-time' documentation fetcher that plugs into Cursor or Claude Code, slashing bills and making developers trust their AI again.",
