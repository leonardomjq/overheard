  "signal_count": 5,
  "thesis": "Developer teams are actively migrating away from Kubernetes to simpler deployment solutions like Kamal and Docker Compose. The primary driver is cost reduction (70%+ savings reported) and complexity reduction (90%+ reported). This creates opportunities in the deployment simplification tooling space.",
  "strategy": "Build or invest in deployment abstraction tools that offer K8s-like reliability with Docker Compose-like simplicity. Target mid-size teams (10-50 engineers) who adopted K8s prematurely. Key differentiators: zero-config deployments, built-in monitoring, and one-click rollbacks.",
  "risk_factors": [
    "Large enterprises with dedicated platform teams unlikely to migrate",
    "Kubernetes ecosystem continues to improve developer experience",
    "Market may consolidate around 1-2 winners quickly"
